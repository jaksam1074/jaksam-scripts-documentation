# Adding custom vehicles/classes

Adding new vehicles and classes is extremely easy

## Adding a vehicle

To add new vehicles, you'll have to create a new row for each vehicle you want to add in your database table `dealerships_creator_vehicles`

If you want to add your vehicle image, you can add it in `dealerships_creator/_vehicles_images` folder.

The image must be named `spawn_vehicle.webp` (Example adder.webp)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The vehicle's class must exist before you add the vehicle. If the vehicle has a custom class, create the class first
{% endhint %}

## Adding a vehicle class

To add new vehicles class, you'll have to create a new row for each class you want to add in your database table `dealerships_creator_classes`
