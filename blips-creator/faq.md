<summary>Some blips are red</summary>

If some blips are red, is probably because one of your other scripts has a file named `minimap.gfx`

Delete that file and restart the server

<summary>Blips are flashing</summary>

If the blips on the map are flashing, it's because you have more than 99 blips

Unfortunately GTA 5 doesn't support more than 99 blips, so the only way to fix it is reducing the blips count

_Note: If you give to more blips the **same** name and the **same** sprite, they will group together_
