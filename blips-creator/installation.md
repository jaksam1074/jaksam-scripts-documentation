# Installation

The installation of the script is extremely easy

## Steps

1. Download the script and extract it in your resources
2. Add the script in your auto start (example: server.cfg)
3. The script will **automatically** setup the database, in case it doesn't, you can manually run the files in `blips_creator/sql/` folder
4. Configure the options in the config files (be sure to read the comments, they'll explain you everything)
5. To open the menu, you only have to press `SPACE BAR` when you are in the in-game big map

You are ready to go! Enjoy the script üòÅ

## Optional

After the database is setup correctly, you can delete the files in `blips_creator/sql/` folder, so the script won't try to setup the database each time you start the script
