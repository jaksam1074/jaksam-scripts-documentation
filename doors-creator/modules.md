# Modules

Modules are an easy way for Doors Creator to replace certain default features (lockpick, dispatch, logs)

To choose an existing module, you open /doorscreator menu, go in settings, choose it. As easy as that

### How to create a custom module?

Creating a module is extremely easy:

1. Navigate to `doors_creator/_modules` folder
2. Choose the module type you want to create (logs, lockpick, dispatch, etc.)
3. Duplicate an existing module and use it as a template
