# Installation

The installation of the script is extremely easy

## Steps

1. Download the script and extract it in your resources
2. Add the script in your auto start (example: server.cfg)
3. The script will **automatically** setup the database, in case it doesn't, you can manually run the files in `doors_creator/sql/` folder
4. Download and start the [lockpicking script](https://github.com/baguscodestudio/lockpick) _(Credits to_ [_baguscodestudio_](https://github.com/baguscodestudio/lockpick)_)_
5. Add `doors_lockpick` item in your items list as you would do for any script
6. Configure the script from in-game admin menu `/doorscreator`

You are ready to go! Enjoy the script üòÅ

## Optional

After the database is setup correctly, you can delete the files in `doors_creator/sql/` folder, so the script won't try to setup the database each time you start the script
