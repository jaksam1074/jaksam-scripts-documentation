<summary>Can't select a door</summary>

If you can't select a door, it means that the door model is not in the allowed doors list

To add the door model in the list, you can press **H** while selecting the doors

In case you can't select the door after pressing H, these are the possible reasons:

* You have a script which adds a weapon on your character
* The door is not usable for some reasons, if it's a modded MLO is probably fault of it

<summary>Vault door not working</summary>

If a certain door is not working with the vault option, you have to try **both** the ratio and heading options

About the heading, you'll have to find on your own which headings fit better for that door (0-360 are the min/max values), or you can use the simple button to find it, it's in the script

Be sure to try different speeds (like trying a slower speed)

_If a door doesn't work at all, there is nothing possible to do_
