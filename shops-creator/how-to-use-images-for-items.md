# How to use images for items

## Global method

The script allows you to use the images you want for the items, bound to their names, so if an item is named `bread`, the image must be named `bread.png`

You can insert the images you want in the folder `shops_creator/html/images/`

## I want to get the images files from an inventory

To customize the default path where the script will look into for images, you can open the file `shops_creator/integrations/cl_integrations.lua` and edit the`IMAGES_PATH variable to anything you want`
