# How to start

Some concepts that will be useful to begin with the script

### What is a mission?

A mission is a group of stages. After all stages are finished, the mission is concluded

### What is a stage?

A stage is a group of tasks and actions

### What is a task?

Tasks are objectives that the players have to complete in order to proceed in the mission. When all mandatory tasks in a stage are completed, the mission starts the next stage

Few example of tasks:

* **Go to coordinates**: players will have to reach the coordinates to succeed this task
* **Deliver vehicle**: player will have to deliver a vehicle in a zone you decide

### What is an action?

Actions are what the script does automatically during your mission to make things smooth and exciting, for example:

* Spawning entities
* Giving items
* Alerting police

There are 2 types of actions

* **Starting actions**: these are things that happens as soon as a new stage starts
* **Ending actions**: these are things that happens as soon as a stage ends

## Final suggestion

If you want to see how a full mission works, you can import an existing one from **Nexus**, the in-game feature of Missions Creator. After you imported it, try editing it to see how it's done
