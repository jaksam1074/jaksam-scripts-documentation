# Nexus Terms

## What is Nexus?

Nexus is a project by jaksam's scripts that enables server administrators to share and import script data among different servers

## What will be stored?

In simple terms, we store as little sensitive information as possible. Primarily, we save script data, which is non-sensitive. Below is a list of the information that is stored. Please note that this list may be updated, and it is your responsibility to check it periodically

* **Script Version**: The version of the script you are using
* **Shared Script Data**: The specific script data you actively choose to share (e.g., in Jobs Creator, this would be the job data)
* **Server IP**: Stored securely as an SHA256 hash, making it unreadable
* **Player Information**: Includes your player nickname and player identifier

## Rules

The rules are straightforward: exercise good judgment when interacting with the platform. Specifically, refrain from using offensive language in the descriptions of the content you share or in similar contexts. Misuse of Nexus features may result in a Nexus ban. However, you'll still be able to use the script without limitations; only the Nexus features may be restricted, based on the script developer's discretion
