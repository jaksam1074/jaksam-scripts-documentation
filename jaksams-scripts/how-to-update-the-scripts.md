# How to update the scripts

1. Go to [FiveM keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants) to update the script (simply download it again)
2. If your existing script has a `current_config.json` file, keep it to save your changes and use it in the new updated version
3. Check the updates channels to be aware of any database changes

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do **NOT** keep `default_config.json` file, always use the one included in the latest download
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If the version you're updating doesn't have `current_config.json`, you'll need to set up the config files again after the update.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The version you download from FiveM Keymaster, will **always** be the latest version available
{% endhint %}
