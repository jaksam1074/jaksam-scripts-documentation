# How to update the scripts

1. Go to [FiveM keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants) to update the script (simply download it again)
2. If the script has a `current_config.json` file, keep it to avoid losing changes
3. Check the updates channels to be aware of any database changes

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do **NOT** keep `default_config.json` file, always use the one included in the latest download
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If the script doesn't have `current_config.json` file, it means you will have to re-configure the configuration files again after updating the script
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The version you download from FiveM Keymaster, will **always** be the latest version available
{% endhint %}
