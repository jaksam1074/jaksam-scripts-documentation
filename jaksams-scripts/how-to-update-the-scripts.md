# How to update the scripts

To update the script, you only have to go to [FiveM keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants) and redownload the script. The version you download from that page, will **always** be the latest version available

If the script you are updating has `current_config.json` file, you have to keep that file to not lose any change you've made.\
Otherwise, if the script doesn't have any `default_config.json` or `current_config.json` file, it means you will have to re-configure the configuration files again after updating the script

Be sure to read the updates channels to know if there is any change on the database

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do **NOT** keep `default_config.json file`, always use the one included in the latest download
{% endhint %}
