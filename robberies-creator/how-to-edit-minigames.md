# How to edit minigames

You can add any minigame you want, doing so will require a minimum of coding knowledge on your side

1. Add your minigame file in `integrations/minigames` and create your function (taking as example datacrack.lua or any other existing minigame)
2. Edit the file `integrations/cl_hack_minigame.lua` to support your minigame
3.  Edit `html/index.js`, search "datacrack" and you'll be able to add your minigame there as well
