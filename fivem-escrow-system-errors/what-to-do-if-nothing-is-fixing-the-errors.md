# What to do if nothing is fixing the errors

## I followed all steps but nothing is working, what can I do?

If you have followed all steps, then you just have a virus in your server. Try creating a clean server with only the default framework scripts and jaksam's scripts

### How to verify if I have a virus in my server?

Open the file which is being mentioned by jaksam's script with **notepad**, scroll down to the bottom. If there is partially readable code (for example "`local...`"), that's a virus added by something else, because normally the entire file would be encrypted. In this case, you'll have to solve that issue before being able to use any script
