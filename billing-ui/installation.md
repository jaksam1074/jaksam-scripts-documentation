# Installation

The installation of the script is extremely easy

## Steps

1. Download the script and extract it in your resources
2. Add the script in your auto start (example: server.cfg)
3. The script will **automatically** setup the database, in case it doesn't, you can manually run the files in `billing_ui/sql/` folder
4. Configure the options in the config files (be sure to read the comments, they'll explain you everything)
5. (QBCore only) Download and extract [this script](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895599870268817418/987388095169179688/menu\_default.rar) in your resources, **without renaming it**, and add it to auto start (example: server.cfg)

You are ready to go! Enjoy the script üòÅ

## Optional

After the database is setup correctly, you can delete the files in `billing_ui/sql/` folder, so the script won't try to setup the database each time you start the script
